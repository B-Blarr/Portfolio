      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p class="main-text">
        Hi, I’m Benjamin. I’m curious, I learn fast, and I enjoy writing code that not only works,
        but is also well-structured and maintainable. When I hit a roadblock, I stick with it until
        I fully understand the problem. At the moment, I’m particularly interested in the
        intersection of frontend development and AI.

          <p>
            I’m based in Schöningen near Braunschweig / Wolfsburg / Magdeburg, very open to remote work and
            comfortable with commutes when needed.Relocation isn’t currently planned.

          <p>
            I enjoy learning new technologies and can quickly get up to speed with new tools and
            frameworks. AI isn’t just a trend for me — I’m interested in integrating it into
            products in a practical, meaningful way.

          <img src="/icons/learnings.svg" alt="Learnings" />
          <p>
            I work in a structured way: understand the problem first, break it down, then implement
            a clean solution. I care about readability, performance, and a great user experience.
